= GCMUtils client usage =
GCMUtils was created to make it easier to use GCM. It works in cooperation with the standard GCM classes, such as GCMRegistrar.

The main features are:
  * Registration id handling (both for registration and unregistration), that will automatically send a request to a server containing the registration id. Supports features such as exponential backoff.
  * Extended verification of project with {{{GCMUtils.checkExtended(context)}}}. Verifies the GCM service created in the project.
  * Uses the file _gcmutils.properties_ to make it easy to provide configuration options, such as _receiver-url_ and _sender-id_.
  * An alternative base intent service _GCMUtilsBaseIntentService_, that includes a few helper methods, such as automatic registrationId handling.

=Setup=
Read the [http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/gs.html GCM: Getting Started] guide. GCMUtils requires the same initial setup, with generation of the sender id (project id) and API key.

See the [http://code.google.com/p/gcmutils/wiki/ProjectSetup project setup page] for more info on how to include GCMUtils in your project.
